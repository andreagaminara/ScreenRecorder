### Documentation
The class ScreenRecorder is used as an API to call the functions of the FFmpeg library. The methods of the class ScreenRecorder are the following:
- int capture() throw();

    `Asks to the user to set some recording configuration parameters and calls the methods to initialize all the structure needed to perform the recording.`

- void controller() throw();

    `Shows the menu to the user and calls the method to execute the action chosen by the user`

- int start() throw();

    `Starts the recording of video and eventually audio packets`
  
- int stop();

    `Terminates the recording`

- int pause();

    `Stops temporarily the recording (it can be resumed later)`

- int resume() throw();

    `Resumes a recording that was previously paused`

- int open_video_media() throw();

    `Opens video input device`

- int prepare_video_decoder() throw();

    `Creates and initializes the structure used to decode video input packet`

- int prepare_video_encoder() throw();

    `Creates and initializes the structure used to encode video input packet`

- int capture_video() throw();

    `Captures video frames`

- int transcode_video(AVPacket* input_packet, AVFrame* input_frame, int i) throw();

    `Decodes input packets and calls the method to encode them in output packets`
    
- int encode_video(AVFrame* input_frame, int i) throw();

    `Encodes input frames into output packets`

- int open_audio_media() throw();

    `Opens audio input device`

- int prepare_audio_decoder() throw();

    `Creates and initializes the structure used to decode audio input packet`    

- int prepare_audio_encoder() throw();
